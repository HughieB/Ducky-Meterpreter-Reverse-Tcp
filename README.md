# Ducky-Meterpreter-Reverse-Tcp

Hopefully something useful/fun for some fellow noobs!

Adjust DELAYS as required.

A keystoke injection attack that creates an exclusion path allowing us to spawn a meterpreter session on a windows machine.

After creating and hosting your .exe simply change the ip address in the script and point it where you are hosting yours.

In my testing I noticed that after the exclusion path is added, no alert will show unless you attempt to 'getsystem' or 'hashdhump'. Migrate to a different process then attempt.

If you have anything else to add please let me know! :)
